        "When **print_constant()** is called, **x = 3.14** is indeed executed, but the quirk is that Python only saves the **x** variable *temporarily*. Python saves **x** into a kind of **temporary memory**, which is immediately erased after the **print_constant()** finishes running.\n",
        "\n",
        "This explains why **x** is still undefined even after **print_constant()** is called — the temporary memory associated with **print_constant()** is immediately erased after the function finishes running, being freed up for later use.\n",
        "\n",
        "This kind of temporary memory storage doesn't also apply to the code that is being run outside function definitions. If we define **x = 3.14** in our **main program** (outside function definitions), we can use **x** later on without having to worry that it was erased from memory.\n",

        "The temporary memory associated with a function is isolated from the memory associated with the main program. The consequence of this is that we can initialize a variable **x = 10** in the main program, and then execute **x = 3.14** in the body of a function without overwriting the **x** variable of the main program.\n",

        "This memory isolation is useful because we don't have to worry about overwriting variables from the main program when we write functions, or vice-versa. This is especially helpful when we write large programs, and it becomes difficult to remember all the variable names we used.\n",
        "\n",
        "This memory isolation also means that some variables can be accessed only from certain parts of a program. We've already seen in one of the examples above that we couldn't access **x** from the main program because it was only defined in the function definition, which is memory-isolated from the main program.\n",
