Every time Hollywood releases a movie, critics from **Metacritic**, **Fandango**, **Rotten Tomatoes**, and **IMDB** review and rate the film. They also ask the users in their respective communities to review and rate the film. Then, they calculate the average rating from both critics and users and display them on their site.

We'll focus on just the average scores from users, because not all of the sites have scores from critics.\n","\n","The **RT_user_norm**, **Metacritic_user_nom**, **IMDB_norm**, and **Fandango_Ratingvalue** columns contain the average user rating for each movie, normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale. This allows us to compare how the users on each site rated a movie. While using averages isn't perfect because films with a few reviews can skew the average rating, FiveThirtyEight only selected movies with a non-trivial number of ratings to ensure films with only a handful of reviews aren't included.\n","\n","If you look at the first row, which lists the average user ratings for **Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)**, you'll notice that the Fandango ratings, both the actual and the displayed rating, are higher than those from the other sites for a given movie. While calculating and comparing summary statistics give us hard numbers for quantifying the bias, visualizing the data using plots can help us gain a more intuitive understanding. We need a visualization that scales graphical objects to the quantitative values we're interested in comparing. One of these visualizations is a **bar plot**.\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0T1ltc2tnb2lDbHc\">\n","\n","\n","In the bar plot above, the x-axis represented the different ratings and the y-axis represented the actual ratings. An effective bar plot uses categorical values on one axis and numerical values on the other axis. Because bar plots can help us find the category corresponding to the smallest or largest values, it's important that we restrict the number of bars in a single plot. Using a bar plot to visualize hundreds of values makes it difficult to trace the category with the smallest or largest value.\n","\n","If the x-axis contains the categorical values and the rectangular bars are scaled vertically, this is known as a vertical bar plot.
