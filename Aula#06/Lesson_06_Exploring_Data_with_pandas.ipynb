        "As we observed in the previous subsection, our index labels are now integers compared with previously where all our index labels were strings. As a result, this means, that while our dataframe has all of the rows, in the same order, as when we read it in, that the integer position and the label for the index axis is the same. Let's look at an example:\n",

        "\n",
        "This is one of the most confusing parts of selecting data with pandas. You might not come across it often, because a lot of the time you'll work with a dataframe where the index labels are integers, and the dataframe contains all of its original rows, in order. You can use **DataFrame.iloc[]** and **DataFrame.loc[]** interchangeably and it doesn't matter which you chose.\n",
