Let's say we want to indicate the point in time of the first manned mission on the Moon. If we want to use a ratio scale, our zero point must be meaningful and denote the absence of time. For this reason, we'd basically have to begin the counting at the very beginning of time.\n","\n","There are many problems with this approach. One of them is that we don't know with precision when time began (assuming time actually has a beginning), which means we don't know how far away in time we are from that zero point.\n","\n","To overcome this, we can set an arbitrarily zero point, and measure the distance in time from there. Customary, we use the [Anno domini system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini) where the zero point is arbitrarily set at the moment [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) was born. Using this system, we can say that the first manned mission on the Moon happened in 1969. This means that the event happened 1968 years after Jesus' birth (1968 because [there's no year 0 in the Anno domini system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero)).\n","\n","\n","<left><img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JS4xmlS_ipz3xS-O41ebZkScbWvxpphj\"></left>\n","\n","\n","If points in time are measured on an interval scale, we need to avoid quantifying the difference in terms of ratio. For instance, it's not true that twice as much time has passed from year 1000 to year 2000.\n","\n","Another common example has to do with measuring temperature. In day to day life, we usually measure temperature on a Celsius or a Fahrenheit scale. These scales are examples of interval scales.\n","\n","0Â°C or 0Â°F are arbitrarily set zero points and don't indicate the absence of temperature. If 0Â°C or 0Â°F were meaningful zero points, temperatures below 0Â°C or 0Â°F wouldn't be possible. But we know that we can go way below 0Â°C or 0Â°F.\n","\n","If yesterday was 10Â°C, and today is 20Â°C, we can't say that today is twice as hot as yesterday. We can say, however, that today's temperature is 10Â°C more compared to yesterday.\n","\n","Temperature can be measured on a ratio scale too, and this is done using the Kelvin scale. 0 K (0 degrees Kelvin) is not set arbitrarily, and it indicates the lack of temperature.

Between 86 kg and 76 kg, there's an infinity of possible values.

Then we take two values (86.2 and 86.8) from the interval 86 - 87, and break down the interval between these values (86.2 and 86.8) in five equal parts. Then we repeat the process for the interval 86.2 - 86.8.

Most likely, they don't. If the values were measured with a precision of one decimal, we'd probably see that the players have different weights. One player may weigh 76.7 kg, another 77.2 kg, another 77.1 kg.\n","\n","As an important parenthesis here, the weight values in the table above are all 77.0, and the trailing zero suggests a precision of one decimal point, but this is not the case. The values are automatically converted by **pandas** to **float64** because of one **NaN** value in the **Weight** column, and end up with a trailing zero, which gives the false impression of one decimal point precision. So a player was recorded to weigh 77 kg (zero decimals precision), not 77.0 kg (one decimal precision).\n","\n","Returning to our discussion, if we measure the weight with zero decimals precision (which we do in our data set), a player weighing 77.4 kg will be assigned the same weight (77 kg) as a player weighing 76.6 kg. So if a player is recorded to weigh 77 kg, we can only tell that her actual weight is somewhere between 76.5 kg and 77.5 kg. The value of 77 is not really a distinct value here. Rather, it's an **interval** of values.\n","\n","This principle applies to any possible numerical weight value. If a player is measured to weigh 76.5 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.45 kg and 76.55 kg. If a player has 76.50 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.495 kg and 76.505 kg.

The answer is that 88.5 kg is exactly halfway between 88 and 89 kg, and it doesn't necessarily belong to any of those two values. The assignment only depends on how you choose to round numbers: if you round up, then 88.5 kg will be assigned to 89 kg; if you round down, then the value will be assigned to 88 kg.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<left><img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\"></left>\n","\n","Find the real limits for five values of the BMI (body mass index) variable.\n","- We've already extracted the first five BMI values in the data set and rounded each off to a precision of three decimal places.
